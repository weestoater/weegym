## Programme Overview

This is a foundational fitness programme designed to be followed for approximately one month to build a good baseline of current abilities. After establishing this foundation, the intensity can be progressively increased.

### Session Frequency

- **Recommended:** 2-4 times per week
- **Rest Days:** Take a rest day between each session
- **Session Rotation:** Alternate between Day 1 and Day 2 sessions

## Key Training Principles

### 1. Progressive Overload

Progressive overload is the method of gradually increasing the intensity or difficulty of workouts over time. This can be achieved by:

- Increasing the number of sets/reps
- Adding more weight

**Example Progression:**

- Week 1: Chest press 3 sets of 10 reps at 20kg
- Week 2: Chest press 3 sets of 11 reps at 20kg
- Week 3: Chest press 3 sets of 12 reps at 20kg
- Week 4: Chest press 3 sets of 10 reps at 25kg

Once you hit the top end of the rep range, increase the weight slightly. This is the most important aspect of any good training programme as it allows your body to become more efficient and improves strength, endurance, and fitness over time.

### 2. Time Under Tension

Maintain control of the weight at all times with a tempo of:

- **2 seconds concentric (up)**
- **2 seconds eccentric (down)**

This controlled tempo will result in the most muscle growth.

## Warm-Up and Cool-Down

### Warm-Up Importance

Start every workout with a warm-up to:

- Increase blood flow to muscles
- Improve flexibility
- Reduce the risk of injury

### Cool-Down Importance

End every workout with a cool-down to:

- Gradually lower heart rate
- Prevent blood pooling in limbs
- Reduce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)
- Promote muscle recovery

## Training Programme

### Day 1 (M = machine, F = free-weights)

### Day 2 (M = machine, F = free-weights)

_[Specific exercises to be documented based on programme]_

### Cardio Options (Any Day)

**Important:** Perform main cardio at the end of the session to avoid negatively impacting resistance training performance.

## Notes

- The programme structure allows flexibility in scheduling as long as sessions are alternated and rest days are included
- Focus on proper form and controlled movements rather than rushing through exercises
- Track your progress to ensure progressive overload is being applied effectively
